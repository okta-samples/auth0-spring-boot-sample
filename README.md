# Getting Started

Spring Boot Web application secured by Auth0

## OAuth 2.0 and OIDC with Auth0 by Okta

If you don't have a free Auth0 developer account, you can [Sign up](https://auth0.com/signup) for one.

Once you have an account log in using [Auth0 CLI](https://github.com/auth0/auth0-cli#installation).

```bash
$ auth0 login
```

Then, register your Spring Boot app on Auth0 using:

```bash
$ auth0 apps create \
  --name "Auth0 Spring Boot Sample" \
  --description "Auth0 Spring Boot Sample" \
  --type regular \
  --callbacks http://localhost:8080/login/oauth2/code/okta \
  --logout-urls http://localhost:8080
  --reveal
```

Configure the application. Update the `src/main/resources/application.properties` file with the following content:

```properties
okta.oauth2.issuer=YOUR_AUTH0_ORG_URI
okta.oauth2.client-id=YOUR_AUTH0_CLIENT_ID
```

Run 

```bash
OKTA_OAUTH2_CLIENT_SECRET=YOUR_AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET ./gradlew bootRun
```
